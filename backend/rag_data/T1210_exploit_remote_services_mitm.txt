Technique ID: T1210
Name: Exploitation of Remote Services (for MITM)

Description:
Attackers exploit weaknesses in remote services to intercept or manipulate network traffic.

How it works:
- Vulnerable service exploited (SMB, RDP, SSH, VPN).
- Attacker gains position to intercept traffic.
- Can capture credentials or inject commands.

IOC:
- Unexpected authentication attempts.
- Traffic routed through unknown host.
- Failed access attempts involving remote services.

Log Sources:
- Windows Event Logs
- Network firewall logs
- SSH/RDP server logs

Detection:
- Monitor for suspicious remote connections.
- Alert on repeated authentication failures.
- Detect exploitation attempts using IDS signatures.
