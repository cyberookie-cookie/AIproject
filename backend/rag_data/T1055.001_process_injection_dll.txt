Attackers inject malicious DLLs into legitimate processes to evade detection.

How it works:
- Attacker uses techniques like CreateRemoteThread.
- Target process executes malicious code.

IOC:
- Suspicious handle access to remote processes.
- Injections into lsass.exe, svchost.exe, explorer.exe.
- Sysmon Event ID 10 (process access).

Log Sources:
- Sysmon
- Windows Event Logs
