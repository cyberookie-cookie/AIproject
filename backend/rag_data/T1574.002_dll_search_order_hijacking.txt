Technique ID: T1574.002
Name: DLL Search Order Hijacking

Description:
Attackers place a malicious DLL in a location the system loads before the legitimate one.

How it works:
- Drop malicious DLL with same name as legitimate.
- OS loads attacker’s DLL first due to search order.

IOC:
- Unexpected DLLs in application directories.
- Processes loading DLLs from non-standard paths.
- Sysmon Event ID 7 (DLL loaded).

Log Sources:
- Sysmon
- Windows Event Logs
- EDR logs

Detection:
- Monitor DLL load paths.
- Look for unsigned or unusual DLLs loaded by trusted apps.
