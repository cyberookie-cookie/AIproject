Technique ID: T1583.006
Name: Compromise Infrastructure — Botnet for DDoS

Description:
Attackers compromise remote systems to build botnets used for large‑scale DDoS attacks.

How it works:
- Malware infects hosts (IoT, PCs, servers).
- Bots receive commands from C2 to launch floods.

IOC:
- Outbound connections to known botnet C2 servers.
- Devices sending high‑volume unsolicited traffic.
- Unexpected processes running on IoT devices.

Log Sources:
- IDS/IPS
- Firewall logs
- EDR (for infected endpoints)

Detection:
- Detect communication with known botnet C2 IPs.
- Monitor devices for abnormal traffic patterns.
