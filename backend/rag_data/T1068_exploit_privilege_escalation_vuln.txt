Technique ID: T1068
Name: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation

Description:
Attackers exploit OS-level vulnerabilities to gain elevated privileges.

How it works:
- Use kernel exploits (DirtyCow, CVE-xxxx).
- Exploit misconfigurations allowing escalated execution.

IOC:
- Unexpected root/admin privileges gained.
- Execution of known exploit binaries.
- Kernel logs showing unusual access.

Log Sources:
- Sysmon logs
- Linux kernel logs
- Windows Event ID 4672 (special privileges assigned)

Detection:
- Detect exploit signatures.
- Monitor privilege elevation events.
