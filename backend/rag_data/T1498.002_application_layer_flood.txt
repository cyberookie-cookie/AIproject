Technique ID: T1498.002
Name: Application Layer Flood

Description:
Attackers overload the web server or application using HTTP floods, slowloris, or API flooding.

How it works:
- Bots send thousands of HTTP GET/POST requests.
- Server threads become exhausted.

IOC:
- Many repeated requests to the same URL.
- High number of incomplete HTTP sessions.
- Spikes in CPU usage on the web server.

Log Sources:
- Web server logs (Apache, Nginx)
- WAF logs
- Load balancer metrics

Detection:
- Rate limiting alerts.
- Behavior‑based anomaly detection.
