Technique ID: T1557.002
Name: ARP Spoofing / ARP Poisoning

Description:
The attacker sends forged ARP responses to redirect network traffic through their machine.

How it works:
- Sends fake ARP replies claiming “I am the gateway”.
- Victim updates ARP table incorrectly.
- Attacker intercepts, modifies, or relays traffic.

IOC:
- ARP cache contains duplicate or incorrect MAC addresses.
- Multiple ARP replies with mismatched source information.
- Unusual network latency.

Log Sources:
- Network IDS/IPS logs
- ARP monitoring tools
- Sysmon network events (if configured)

Detection:
- Alert when multiple ARP replies conflict.
- Monitor ARP table changes.
- Detect common tools such as arpspoof, ettercap.
