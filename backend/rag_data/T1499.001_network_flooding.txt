Technique ID: T1499.001
Name: Network DoS — Direct Network Flooding

Description:
Attackers flood the victim’s network with a high volume of packets
(UDP flood, SYN flood, ICMP flood) to exhaust bandwidth and interrupt service.

How it works:
- Massive bursts of packets sent from bots or spoofed IPs.
- Network devices become saturated and stop responding.

IOC:
- Extremely high inbound traffic.
- Many packets with spoofed source IPs.
- Sudden drop in legitimate connections.

Log Sources:
- Firewall logs
- Netflow / PCAP
- IDS/IPS systems

Detection:
- Detect abnormal spikes in traffic.
- Identify repeated SYN, UDP, or ICMP requests.
