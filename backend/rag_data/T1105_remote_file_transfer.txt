Technique ID: T1105
Name: Ingress Tool Transfer (Remote File Transfer)

Description:
Attackers transfer files from an external system onto a compromised machine.  
This is commonly used to deliver malware, upload tools (Mimikatz, netcat), or download stolen data.

How it works:
- Attacker uses PowerShell to download a file (Invoke-WebRequest, curl).
- Malware retrieves payloads from a remote server.
- Tools like SCP, FTP, SMB, or custom C2 channels transfer files.

IOC:
- PowerShell commands with download URLs.
- Processes connecting to suspicious external IPs.
- Files created in temp directories after web requests.
- Unusual outbound traffic spikes.

Log Sources:
- Sysmon (Event ID 3: network connection, Event ID 1: process creation)
- Windows Event Logs
- Firewall logs
- Proxy/web gateway logs

Detection:
- Alert on PowerShell downloading files via HTTP/HTTPS.
- Detect unknown executables written to temp or user directories.
- Flag connections to known malicious file-hosting servers.
