Technique ID: T1110.004
Name: Password Spraying

Description:
Attacker tries one password against many different user accounts to avoid lockouts.

How it works:
- Uses common passwords like "Welcome1", "Password123".
- Targets large sets of users.
- Occurs slowly to avoid detection.

IOC:
- 1 failed attempt per user across many accounts.
- Same password attempted repeatedly.
- Attempts from one suspicious IP.

Log Sources:
- AD logs
- Linux auth.log
- Web authentication logs

Detection:
- Detect one-failure-per-account patterns.
- Identify same password used across multiple accounts.
