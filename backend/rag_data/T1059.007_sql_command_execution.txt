Technique ID: T1059.007
Name: SQL Command Execution

Description:
Attackers inject SQL commands into vulnerable input fields to execute actions on the database.

How it works:
- Sends SQL payloads like `' OR 1=1 --` or `UNION SELECT`.
- Bypasses authentication or dumps data.
- May lead to RCE if DB interaction allows command execution.

IOC:
- Requests containing SQL keywords (SELECT, UNION, DROP).
- Repeated database errors.
- Login bypass attempts.

Log Sources:
- Web server access logs
- Application logs
- Database logs

Detection:
- Identify suspicious SQL payloads.
- Correlate multiple failed SQL queries.
- Use WAF signatures to detect SQLi.
