Technique ID: T1499.002
Name: Protocol Flood

Description:
Attackers abuse a specific protocol (DNS, NTP, SSDP, LDAP) to overwhelm the target.

How it works:
- Reflection/amplification attacks using open resolvers.
- Small attacker request → large reflected response.

IOC:
- Large volumes of DNS, NTP, or SSDP traffic.
- Requests from unusual or spoofed IPs.
- Traffic amplification patterns.

Log Sources:
- DNS server logs
- Firewall logs
- DDoS monitoring tools

Detection:
- Monitor unusual protocol spikes.
- Detect reflection/amplification indicators.
